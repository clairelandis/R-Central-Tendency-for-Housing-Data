# Project completed based on data from CodeAcademy

R-Central-Tendency-for-Housing-Data

In this project, we will find the mean, median, and mode cost of one-bedroom apartments in three of the five New York City boroughs: Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens.

Using your findings, we will make conclusions about the cost of living in each of the boroughs. We will also discuss an important assumption that we make when we point out differences between the boroughs.

We worked with Streeteasy.com to collect this data.
